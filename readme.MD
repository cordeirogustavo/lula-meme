# 🛒 Lula Strategy - The Meme Project

Welcome to **Lula Strategy**, a revolutionary (meme) approach to decision-making in supermarkets! Inspired by the eternal struggle of whether or not to buy that overpriced product, this Node.js app guides users through a completely serious and not-at-all satirical pricing strategy.

## 🎭 What is This?

This project is a **meme-driven decision-making system** that:

- Asks users **if a product is too expensive**
- Determines if **everyone has conscience**
- Decides **whether or not to buy the product**
- Attempts to **lower the price** through a strategic loop
- Ultimately declares **LULA WINS** 🎉

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js 21+** installed, then run:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Strategy

To start the meme-powered economic revolution, execute:

```sh
npm start
```

Or, for development mode with hot reload:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Answer the Questions

The app will ask you questions like:

```
Enter the city: Salvador
Enter the product name: Caviar
Suspect is 'TAL PRODUTO' expensive? Y/N: Y
Everyone has conscience? Y/N: Y
Do not buy TAL PRODUTO
Try to reduce price? Y/N: N
Supermarket will not reduce product price. The product will expire. LULA WINS!!
Try to reduce price? Y/N: Y
Supermarket will reduce product price.
Strategy works successfully!! LULA WINS!!
```
